# This Is Home - Kit Chan

- Whenever I am feeling low
- I look around me and I know
- There's a place that will stay within me
- Wherever I may choose to go
- I will always recall the city
- Know every street and shore
- Sail down the river which brings us life
- Winding through my Singapore

- This is home truly, where I know I must be
- Where my dreams wait for me, where the river always flows
- This is home surely, as my senses tell me
- This is where I won't be alone, for this is where I know it's home

- When there are troubles to go through
- We'll find a way to start anew
- There is comfort in the knowledge
- That home's about its people too
- So we'll build our dreams together
- Just like we've done before
- Just like the river which brings us life
- There'll always be Singapore

- This is home truly, where I know I must be
- Where my dreams wait for me, where the river always flows
- This is home surely, as my senses tell me
- This is where I won't be alone, for this is where I know it's home

- This is home truly, where I know I must be
- Where my dreams wait for me, where the river always flows
- This is home surely, as my senses tell me
- This is where I won't be alone, for this is where I know it's home

- For this is where I know it's home
- For this is where I know I'm home
